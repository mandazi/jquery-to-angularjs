# jquery-to-angularjs
Examples from the talk I gave at NoVa.JS called "From jQuery to AngularJS: A Beginner's Guide" on 11/5/2015

## How to run

`node server`

Then go to: localhost:8080

I am using node to run a simple web server to serve the flat HTML files.
I used Bower to download jQuery, AngularJS and Bootstrap (just using the css).
